This is an exercise we did in our web development school.

1. The teacher provided us the JSON file giving us the API with the list of countries to display in the select button JSON: api-nazioni.json
The file could be retrieved from this access https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pmontrasio/codici-stati/master/dist/countries.json

2. The API that we used for the weather forecast was available at this address https://openweathermap.org/current
